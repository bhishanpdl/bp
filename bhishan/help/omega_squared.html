	A less biased estimator of the variance explained in the population is ω2<br><br>

	omega_squared = <br>
	SS_treatment - df_treatment * MS_error <br>
	------------------------------------------<br>
	SS_total + MS_error<br><br>

	This form of the formula is limited to between-subjects analysis with equal sample sizes in all cells. Since it is less biased (although not unbiased), ω2 is preferable to η2; however, it can be more inconvenient to calculate for complex analyses. A generalized form of the estimator has been published for between-subjects and within-subjects analysis, repeated measure, mixed design, and randomized block design experiments. In addition, methods to calculate partial ω2 for individual factors and combined factors in designs with up to three independent variables have been published.s
